      "question": "Which antibiotics target peptidoglycan biosynthesis?",
      "predicted": " The question you've asked is not related to the context provided, which discusses mitochondrial diseases associated with POLG mutations. To answer your question, antibiotics that target peptidoglycan biosynthesis include beta-lactams such as penicillin and cephalosporins, aminoglycosides like gentamicin, and macrolides like erythromycin. These classes of antibiotics are essential for treating bacterial infections by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls.",
      "expected": "Under some conditions, both ramoplanin and vancomycin probes produce helicoid staining patterns along the cylindrical walls of B. subtilis cells. This work has implications for the design of ramoplanin derivatives and may influence how other proposed substrate binding antibiotics are studied. This was confirmed by in vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction from Gaffkya homari in which peptidoglycan synthesis from UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide was inhibited by ramoplanin but not by vancomycin. New results support a two-state model for septal and peripheral PG synthesis at mid-cell, involvement of essential cell division proteins in PG remodeling, and mid-cell localization of proteins that organize PG biosynthesis and that form the protein translocation apparatus.",

Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease and is not directly related to peripheral neuroepithelioma or Ewing sarcoma, which are types of tumors. To answer your question, the cells driving Rheumatoid Arthritis are primarily immune cells such as T cells, B cells, and macrophages.",
      "expected": "Macrophages, T cells and their respective cytokines play a pivotal role in RA. Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) constitute a quite unique cell type that distinguishes RA from other inflammatory conditions of the joints. Activated synovial fibroblasts (SFs) have the ability to invade joint cartilage, actively contributing to joint destruction in RA.",

      "predicted": " The provided context does not provide information about the association between personality trait of neuroticism and risk for Alzheimer's disease. However, research suggests that higher levels of neuroticism may be associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, but more studies are needed to confirm this relationship.",
      "expected": "High neuroticism is associated with increased risk to develop Alzheimer's disease. Greater neuroticism is also associated more advanced Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and younger age of dementia onset. Neuroticism's association with late-life dementia mainly reflects vulnerability to stress and anxiety. Neuroticism moderates the relationship between APOE-4 genotype and cognitive outcomes in elderly. Neuroticism also predicts Mild Cognitive Impairment, Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline and cognitive decline among elderly. Alzheimer's disease patients have greater neuroticism relative to controls.",

      "question": "Does the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?",
      "predicted": " The provided context does not directly address the question about the co-localization of the CTCF protein with cohesin. However, it's important to note that the context is focused on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their splicing, not the interaction between proteins like CTCF and cohesin. To answer your question, research on the role of CTCF protein often involves studying its interactions with other proteins, including cohesin, in various biological processes such as chromatin organization and gene regulation. Therefore, it is generally accepted that CTCF does co-localize with cohesin in many cellular contexts. For a more accurate and detailed answer, I would recommend consulting relevant scientific literature or speaking with a biomedical researcher specializing in this area.",
      "expected": "Recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with cohesin.",

Direct sequencing of CREBBP performed in 13 RSTS patients identified the three zinc fingers (CH1, CH2, CH3) and HAT domain as mutational hotspots. Thus about 55% of patients have cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities in the Crebbp or E1A binding protein p300 (Ep300) gene, leaving the diagnosis in 45% of patients to rest on clinical features only.",
